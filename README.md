# Weather and Air Quality ETL Pipeline

## Overview
This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for collecting and processing historical weather and air pollution data for a specified location.
The pipeline fetches data from external APIs, transforms it into a clean and structured tabular format, and then loads the processed data into a database.
The goal of this project is to provide a robust and well-transformed dataset that can be used for further analysis, visualization and reporting.
